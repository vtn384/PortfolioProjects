NYPD Crime Statistics Analysis

Introduction:
This project analyzes a dataset of crime statistics from the New York Police Department (NYPD). The data includes information on reported crimes, suspects, victims, and locations. The goal of this project is to extract insights and draw conclusions from the data using SQL queries.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is provided by the NYPD and contains crime statistics from 2019. It includes over 400,000 rows of data on crimes that occurred in New York City, including the type of crime, the date it was reported, the location, and information on the suspects and victims involved.

Analysis:
This project uses SQL queries to analyze the NYPD crime statistics dataset. The queries answer various questions about the data, such as:
What is the total number of reported crimes in the dataset?
What is the most common type of crime in the dataset?
What are the top 10 locations where crimes occur the most?
What is the number of reported crimes by borough?
What is the percentage of reported crimes that occur in each borough?
What is the number of reported crimes that occurred in each zip code?
What is the percentage of reported crimes that occurred in each zip code?
What is the average age of the suspects and victims involved in reported crimes?
What is the percentage of reported crimes in which the suspect or victim was male or female?

Conclusion:
The analysis of the NYPD crime statistics dataset provides valuable insights into the nature and extent of crime in New York City. By using SQL queries to analyze the data, we were able to answer important questions about crime rates, types of crimes, locations, suspects, and victims. These insights can help law enforcement agencies and policymakers to better understand crime trends and develop effective strategies to combat crime in the city.
